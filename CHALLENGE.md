## Whiteboard Challenge 03

Complete today's whiteboard challenge and follow the submission instructions below:

*You're the junior conductor on a commuter train, and have been asked by the senior conductor to do a head count of passengers on the train.*

*Write a function `const traverse = (engine) => {...` which takes the engine as a starting location. Travel from the engine to the caboose, and total the number of passengers in each car as your progress. `return` the final total once your traversal is complete.*

*Each car, including the engine will have the following signature:*
    ```js
    { <engine>
        value: 2,
        next: {  <next car>
            value: 16,
            next: { <next car>
        }
    }
    ```
